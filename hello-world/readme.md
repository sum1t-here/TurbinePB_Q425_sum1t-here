# Hello World - Rust

A simple "Hello, world!" program written in Rust.

## Prerequisites

- Rust compiler (`rustc`) installed on your system
- If you don't have Rust installed, visit [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/) to install it

## How to Run

### Step 1: Compile the program

Open your terminal in the directory containing `main.rs` and run:

```bash
rustc main.rs
```

This will compile the Rust source code and create an executable file named `main` (or `main.exe` on Windows).

### Step 2: Run the executable

After compilation, run the program:

**On Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./main
```

## Expected Output

```
Hello, world!
```
